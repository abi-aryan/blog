Abi's Personal Homepage 

#### Update: Mon, Oct 26, 2020
- While I do finally have a website set up however the amount of options when it comes to commenting software are massive and it's tiring me down. So I am going to push commenting support down the priority list for now. Or maybe I will integrate comments.js only - however it would be far better if I could just stick to one commenting platform and activate it whenever that maybe, even if it some time later down the lane.
- I am re-creating the priority list for this web presence -
    1. Edit existing blogposts and insert pictures
        - [x] Collaborative AI -> Developing A.I. using Games (due 27 Oct, no review needed)
        - [x] Open Questions in Artificial Life (due 28 Oct, needs review)
        - [x] State of AI - Summer 2019 (due 29 Oct, needs review)
        - [x] Why TensorLayer? (due 30 Oct, no review needed)
        - [x] Associative Memory (due 31 Oct, no review needed)
    2. Activate my publications tab.
    3. Write more blogposts and release them

#### Update: Mon, Oct 27, 2020
- I finished editing the blogposts for all formatting issues caused by the Wordpress import. 
- Added a custom feature i.e. date on the homepage for all recent posts.
- Two blogposts need review to be considered complete. This is important but not urgent, will be considered while adding commenting platform.
    - [x] Open Questions in Artificial Life (needs review) : Review includes answering these questions in a paragraph or so on each question
    - [x] State of AI - Summer 2019 (needs review) : Review includes adding more information on the points mentioned in a paragraph or so on each topic
- All personal advice blogposts have been moved into _old-posts as an archive for later. (yet to be edited for formatting issues and missing links)
- Next Priorities:
    1. Update my publications and activate the publications tab
    2. Write more blogposts and release them.
    3. Push all my existing Colab notebooks on blogpost.
