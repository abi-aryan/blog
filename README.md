Abi's Personal Homepage 

Update: Mon, Oct 26, 2020
- While I do finally have a website set up however the amount of options when it comes to commenting software are massive and it's tiring me down. So I am going to push commenting support down the priority list for now. Or maybe I will integrate comments.js only - however it would be far better if I could just stick to one commenting platform and activate it whenever that maybe, even if it some time later down the lane.
- I am re-creating the priority list for this web presence -
1. Edit existing blogposts and insert pictures
2. Activate my publications tab.
3. Write more blogposts and release them
