My name is Abi Aryan. I am an A.I. Researcher and Engineer and currently a Data Science Fellow at Insight in Toronto. I was previously a Visiting Research Scholar at UCLA under Dr. Judea Pearl.

I attended London School of Economics for a masters in Applicable Mathematics and did my bachelors in mathematics with minors in statistics and computer science from MDU.

### Interests

I am, foremost, driven by the goal to create personalized humane-agents that can influence and alter human decision making.

My areas of interest include automated pipelines, emotion recognition, embodied cognition, natural language processing, evolutionary computation, large scale distributed systems, and complex dynamical systems.
