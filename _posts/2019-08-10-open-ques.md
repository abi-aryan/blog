Following are some of the listed open problems in the field of Artificial Life broadly classified into three main categories-

**How does life arise from the nonliving?**

1. Determine whether fundamentally novel living organizations can exist.
2. Simulate a unicellular organism over its entire life cycle.
3. Explain how rules and symbols are generated from physical dynamics in living systems.

**What are the potentials and limits of living systems?**

1. Determine what is inevitable in the open-ended evolution of life.
2. Determine minimal conditions for evolutionary transitions from specific to generic response systems.
3. Create a formal framework for synthesizing dynamical hierarchies at all scales.
4. Determine the predictability of evolutionary consequences of manipulating organisms and ecosystems.
5. Develop a theory of information processing, information flow, and information generation for evolving systems

**How is life related to mind, machines, and culture?**

1. Demonstrate the emergence of intelligence and mind in an artificial living system.
2. Evaluate the influence of machines on the next major evolutionary transition of life.
3. Provide a quantitative model of the interplay between cultural and biological evolution.
Establish ethical principles for artificial life.
